# libs/license_handle.py
"""License template handling for the Thon Code License Manager.

Supports:
  * Discovery of license templates bundled with the IDE (source tree and
    PyInstaller frozen builds via sys._MEIPASS).
  * Fall-back "builtin templates" written on first run when the
    on-disk ``assets/license`` directory is empty or missing – this
    avoids the classic symptom "template hierarchy broken so I have to
    close the Git window to do anything".
  * Variable interpolation using ``[key]`` and ``{{key}}`` placeholders
    (``year`` / ``author`` are the two the License Manager UI fills in).
